# How to create a Radar Point chart

The following example demonstrates how to create a [Radar Point](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3316/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/2d-series-views/radar-series-views/radar-point-chart?p=netframework) chart at runtime.

Note that this series view type is associated with the [Radar Diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5907/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/radar-and-polar-diagrams?p=netframework) type, and you should cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.Diagram?p=netframework) object to this type, in order to access its specific options.
